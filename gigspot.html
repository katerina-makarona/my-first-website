        <h2>Project Overview</h2>

        <p> 
            This case study explores the design and development of GigSpot, a mobile app tailored for people who love music. The project aimed to address the challenge of finding live music events efficiently, considering user pain points and preferences.

            Through user research, competitive analysis, and iterative wireframe design, GigSpot was developed to enhance live music discovery, foster artist-audience connections, and streamline ticket booking. The focus was on creating an intuitive interface and providing personalized event recommendations, ensuring an engaging user experience for music lovers worldwide.
        </p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>

        <p>
            Many people find it difficult to discover live music events that match their interests and location. Browsing multiple websites or social media is time-consuming and often ineffective. 

            This leads to missed events and frustration, making it hard for users to stay connected with their favourite artists and local music scenes.    
        </p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>

        <p>
        GigSpot simplifies live music discovery by offering a platform tailored to user preferences like genre, date, and venue. Instead of searching multiple sites, users can find personalized concert recommendations in one place.
        With features like following artists and saving favorite venues, users can easily stay connected and discover events that match their tastes and location, without the hassle of browsing through irrelevant options.
        </p>

        <h2> Competitive Analysis</h2>

        <p> 
        I conducted a competitive analysis of leading apps in the industry to evaluate user interfaces and identify best practices.
